Free Response Questions
Do not use a calculator for these questions. You should be able to solve these qualitatively using the properties of
logarithms.

Logarithms and Exponents

    1. Compute all powers of 2 up to 10. I.e. write 2^0, 2^1, 2^2, ..... 2^10
        1 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256 512 1024

    2. What does logarithm mean? If you were given log(n) = x, describe in plain English the relationship between
    n and x.
        x is the number of times the number n is multiplied by itself - orders of magnitude in base10

    3. How much larger is 2^31 than 2^28? Hint: Do not compute them each.
        3 times larger

    4. How much larger is 1 billion than 1 million?
        1,000 times larger, base 10
        log2(1_000), ~ log2(1024), so ~10

    5. How much larger is log(1 million) than log(1 billion)?
        log10(1 million) = 6
        log10(1 billion) = 9
        +3 larger

    6. If log(64) = y, write log(128) in terms of y.
        y + 1

    7. If log(x) = 128, write 128 in terms of x without using the logarithm.
        x = 2^128

    8. If log(x / y) = 4, write a relationship between x/y without using the logarithm.
        x*(2^4) = y; x = y/(2^4)

    9. If log(x * y) = 8, write a relationship of x,y without using the logarithm.
        x * y = 2^8; x = (2^8)/y; y = (2^8)/x

    10. If the x = 2^8. Rewrite x using base 4. If x = 4^y what is y?
        log4 x

Geometric Series

    1. What is a geometric series? Give 4 examples of different geometric series. If possible, compute their sum or
    explain why you can't.
        - summation from k=0 to +inf of (a * r^k)
        - a geometric series is the sum of an infinite series with a constant ratio between successive terms
        - geometric series exhibit one of three behaviors:
            a. convergence, i.e. they approach a finite value, which can be found by taking the limit of its closed
            form, iff the absolute value of the ratio between successive terms is less than one
            b. divergence, i.e. they infinitely diverge, iff the absolute value of the ratio between successive terms is
            is greater than or equal to one
            c. oscillation, i.e. they flip between two values, neither converging nor diverging, but oscillating iff the
            ratio between successive terms is exactly -1; n(-1)^n
        - note: all bounded series (i.e. contain boundaries) are finite in the absence of unbounded terms (infinities)

        examples:
        convergence: r < 1
            1. square numbers series a = 1 and r = k
                closed form: (n/2)*(n + 1)
                binomial coefficient: (n + 1) choose 2
            2. 128 + 64 + 32 + 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8... -> 256
        divergence:
            3. r > 1 -> +inf
                1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32... -> +inf
        oscillation:
            4. r = -1 -> Â±a in (a*(r^k))
                Grandi's Series: sum from k=0 to +inf of -1^k -> 1, -1, 1, -1, 1...
                    notice: 0 if k % 2 == 0; -1 if k % 2 != 0


    2. We say a series "converges" if you can compute the sum. What types of geometric series converge? You don't need
    to prove it - just describing it is fine. You can also use examples to explain your idea.
        - any geometric series with r < 1, in (a * r^k), will converge, with the series approaching (converging to) 0 in
        the limit
        - a*.5^1 + a*.5^2 + a*.5^3 + ... a*((1/2)^k) ... as k -> inf, a*(1/inf) -> 0; lim a*(1/inf) -> 0
        - such convergence (when r < 1) produces the closed form (a / (1 - r)) in sum from k=0 to inf of a*(r^k)

    3. Compute 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 + 64 as a power of 2 minus an additional term.
        2^(n+1) - 1

    4. Compute 64 + 32 + 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 as a power of 2 minus an additional term.
        2^(n+1) - 1

    5. Compute 1 + 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8.
        8/8 + 4/8 + 2/8 + 1/8 = (8 + 7)/8 = 15/8

    6. Compute 1 + 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 + 1/32.
        32/32 + 16/32 + 8/32 + 4/32 + 2/32 + 1/32 = (32 + 31)/32 = 63/32

    7. If you keep adding more terms to the geometric series, what does it look like you get closer to? I.e., what does
    the series 1 + 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + .... equal?
        2

    8. Now assume the sum goes from 64 down to 0 like this:
        a. 64 + 32 + 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8... What is this equal to?
            (2n - 1) + (1) = ~128

    9. Compute  9 + 90 + 900 + 9000 as a power of 10 minus an additional term.
        10^n - 1

    10. What does 9000 + 900 + 90 + 9 + 9/10 + 9/100 + ... approach?
        10,000

    These 2 code blocks look similar but have different runtimes in big O notation.
    How are they different? Why?
        A: has a runtime of O(N)
        B: has a runtime of O(log N)^2)
        The inner (for) loops have different dependencies. (A) depends on the outer (while) loop, while (B) does not.
        This can produce fundamentally different behavior, here: the for loop is doubling (inner) log(n) (outer) times.
        Therefore, 2^log2(n) -> O(n)

        # Block (A)
        def fn_a(N):
          count = 0
          i = 1
          while i < N:
              for j in range(0, i):
                  count += 1
              i = i * 2
          return count

        # Block (B):
        def fn_b(N)
          count = 0
          i = 1
          while i < N:
              for j in range(0, N):
                  count += 1
              i = i * 2
          return count

Linked List

    1. (a) What is a linked list? (b) How is it built? (c) What is the underlying data structure used?
        (a) a linked list is a series of nodes connected by references to the next node.
        (b) linked lists are built by connecting new nodes the last linked node (either a dummy, head, or last node)
        (c) the underlying data structure of linked lists is a node, which typically contains data (e.g. value) and a
        reference to the next node

    2. What is the runtime to insert an element to the front of a linked list?
        as we'll already have a direct reference to the element, and the remaining operations are constant, O(1)

    3. What is the runtime to search if a specific element is in a linked list?
        in the worst the sought element will be the last element, hence, n, or O(n)

    4. What is one example of when a linked list is preferred over an array of a fixed size?
        1. when the required list size is not known: linked lists are space optimal vs allocating fixed size arrays
        2. frequent insertion/deletions: insertion/deletions do not require shifting other elements
        3. ...

    5. What is one example of when an array of fixed size is preferred over a linked list?
        1. small data set
        2. where size is fixed, and unchanging
        3. maximum memory/runtime performance is sought
        4. ...

    6. Describe how you would insert an element into the front of a linked list. How is this different from inserting to
    the end of one?
        pseudo code:
            assign the new node's next_node reference to the current head node
            reassign the head node reference to the new node
        to insert a new node to the end of a linked list (append), you must first traverse the list or otherwise obtain
        a reference to the last node

    7. How would you identify if there is a cycle in a linked list?
        1. either use Floyd's cycle section algorithm (fast & slow pointers)
        2. keep track of visited nodes

    8. Please walk through your approach using the following examples, including all intermediate steps.

        Linked list with cycle (d -> a)
        a --> b --> c --> d
        ^                 |
        |                 V
        <-----------------

        1. Floyd's cycle detection:
            p1 & p2 start head
            while p2 not None and p2.next not None and p1 != p2
                p1 move 1
                p2 move 2

            p1 = p2 = a
            p1.next = b
            p2.next.next = c
            b ?= c
            p1.next = c
            p2.next.next = a
            c ?= a
            p1.next = d
            p2.next.next = c

         Linked list with no cycle 1 --> 4 --> 3 --> 2 --> None

        1. Floyd's cycle detection:
            p1 & p2 start head
            while not None and p1 != p2
                p1 move 1
                p2 move 2

            p1 = p2 = 1
            p1.next = 4
            p2.next.next = 3
            4 ?= 3
            p1.next = c
            p2.next.next = a
            c ?= a
            p1.next = d
            p2.next.next = c
            d ?= c
            p1.next = a
            p2.next.next = a
            a ?= a

            record 1
            1.next = 4
            seen 4?
            record 4
            4.next = 3

    9. Explain how you would reverse a linked list. Explain using the following example.

        a. 1 --> 4 --> 3 --> 2 --> None

    10. How do you iterate through a linked list? Describe this process in detail if you want to print every element in
    a linked list.
        node = head
        while node:
            print(node.val)
            node = node.next

        starting with the head of the linked list as your inspected_node, print the value of this node (assuming it's
        not a dummy node), then assign the destination of the current next_node pointer as the inspected_node_pointer

    11. How can we use linked lists to implement a stack?
        insertions replace the head, which represents the top of the stack; O(1) time

    12. Why do you need two pointers for a queue but not required to implement a stack?
        within the context of maintaining constant runtime for insertions and removals:
            queues require two pointers; one pointer for inserting new nodes, and one pointer for removing from the
            queue whereas a stack requires only one pointer at the head (the top of the stack)

    13. When would you want to use a doubly linked list?
        when bidirectional traversal is required or otherwise advantageous

    14. What are the differences between stack/queue/deque? What are their core functions and runtimes?
        stack: LIFO; add O(1); remove O(1); space O(n)
        queue: FIFO; add inverse of remove O(1) or O(n); remove inverse of add O(n) or O(1); space O(n)
        deque: FIFO or LIFO; add O(1); remove O(1); space O(n); note: runtime optimal implementation of a queue
        insert is O(n) for all

    15. What are some challenges when iterating through a circular linked list?
        finding the relative location of cycle entry node

    16. Why are queues better than stacks for ticket lines?
        maximizes fairness (i.e. "situational independence") by minimizing temporal mode deviation between customers

Linked List Code Analysis

    Below is a LinkedList class.

    class Node:
        def __init__(self, val):
            self.val = val
            self.next = None


    class LinkedList:
        def __init__(self, node):
            # head references first node in chain of nodes
            self.head = node

        def function1(self, new_node):
            new_node.next = self.head
            self.head = new_node

        def function2(self, new_node):
            if self.head is None:
                self.head = new_node
            return

            cur = self.head
            while(cur.next):
                cur = cur.next
            cur.next = new_node

        def function3(self):
            if self.head:
                self.head = self.head.next

    1. Describe function1 and its runtime.
        inserts a new node as the head of the linked list; O(n)

    2. Describe function2 and its runtime.
        inserts the provide node into an empty linked list, if the list is empty
        if not, traverses to the end of the list, and appends the provided onto the end of the list

    3. Describe function3 and its runtime.
        via traversal, reassigns the head of the linked list to the next node until the assignment is None...
        without a reference to the head node, this will effectively delete the linked list
        (self.head = None) is O(1) while function3 is O(n)


Stacks

    stack = Stack()
    stack.push(1)
    stack.push(2)
    print(stack.pop())
    stack.push(3)
    stack.push(4)
    print(stack.pop())
    print(stack.pop())

    1. What is printed when the above code is run?
        2\n4\n3\n

    2. What is the current state of the stack after the above code is run?
        stack(1, )

    3. Give one real-life example of a Stack.
        things placed on top of each other, such as plates

Queues

    queue = Queue()
    queue.enqueue(1)
    queue.enqueue(2)
    print(queue.dequeue())
    queue.enqueue(3)
    queue.enqueue(4)
    print(queue.dequeue())
    print(queue.dequeue())

    1. What is printed when this code is run?
        1\n2\n3\n

    2. What is the current state of the queue after this code is run?
        queue(4, )

    3. Give one real-life example of a Queue.
        standing in a line to, e.g. buy tickets
