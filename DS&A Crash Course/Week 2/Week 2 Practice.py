Free Response Questions
Do not use a calculator for these questions. You should be able to solve these qualitatively using the properties of
logarithms.

Logarithms and Exponents

    1. Compute all powers of 2 up to 10. I.e. write 2^0, 2^1, 2^2, ..... 2^10
        1 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256 512 1024

    2. What does logarithm mean? If you were given log(n) = x, describe in plain English the relationship between
    n and x.
        x is the number of times a number is multiplied by itself - orders of magnitude in base10

    3. How much larger is 2^31 than 2^28? Hint: Do not compute them each.
        3 times larger

    4. How much larger is 1 billion than 1 million ?
        1,000 times larger

    5. How much larger is log(1 million) than log(1 billion) ?
        4 times larger

    6. If log(64) = y, write log(128) in terms of y.
        y*2

    7. If log(x) = 128, write 128 in terms of x without using the logarithm.
        x = 2^128

    8. If log(x / y) = 4, write a relationship between x/y without using the logarithm.
        x*(2^4) = y; x = y/(2^4)

    9. If log(x * y) = 8, write a relationship of x,y without using the logarithm.
        x * y = 2^8; x = (2^8)/y; y = (2^8)/x

    10. If the x = 2^8. Rewrite x using base 4. If x = 4^y what is y?
        log4 x

Geometric Series

    1. What is a geometric series? Give 4 examples of different geometric series. If possible, compute their sum or
    explain why you can't.
        summation from k=0 to inf of (a * r^k);
        a geometric series is the sum of an infinite series with a constant ratio between successive terms

        compute closed forms todo

        examples:
        convergence: r < 1
            1. square numbers series a = 1 and r = k
                closed form: (n/2)*(n + 1)
                binomial coefficient: (n + 1) choose 2
            2.
        divergence:
            3. r > 1 -> +inf
        oscillation:
            4. r = -1 -> Â±a in (a*(r^k))


    2. We say a series "converges" if you can compute the sum. What types of geometric series converge? You don't need
    to prove it - just describing it is fine. You can also use examples to explain your idea.
        any geometric series with r < 1, in (a * r^k), will converge, with the series approaching (converging to) 0 in
        the limit
        a*.5^1 + a*.5^2 + a*.5^3 + ... a*((1/2)^k) ... as k -> inf, a*(1/inf) -> 0; lim a*(1/inf) -> 0
        such convergence (when r < 1) produces the closed form (a / (1 - r)) in sum from k=0 to inf of a*(r^k)

    3. Compute 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 + 64 as a power of 2 minus an additional term.
        2^(n+1) - 1

    4. Compute 64 + 32 + 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 as a power of 2 minus an additional term.

    the series 1 + 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + .... equal?
        todo

    8. Now assume the sum goes from 64 down to 0 like this:
        a. 64 + 32 + 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8... What is this equal to?

Linked List

    1. (a) What is a linked list? (b) How is it built? (c) What is the underlying data structure used?
        (a) a linked list is a series of nodes connected by references to the next node.
        (b) linked lists are built by connecting new nodes the last linked node (either a dummy, head, or last node)
        (c) the underlying data structure of linked lists is a node, which typically contains data (e.g. value) and a
        reference to the next node

    2. What is the runtime to insert an element to the front of a linked list?
        as we'll already have a direct reference to the element, and the remaining operations are constant, O(1)

    3. What is the runtime to search if a specific element is in a linked list?
        in the worst the sought element will be the last element, hence, n, or O(n)

    4. What is one example of when a linked list is preferred over an array of a fixed size?
        1. when the required list size is not known: linked lists are space optimal vs allocating fixed size arrays
        2. frequent insertion/deletions: insertion/deletions do not require shifting other elements
        3. ...

    5. What is one example of when an array of fixed size is preferred over a linked list?
        1. small data set
        2. where size is fixed, and unchanging
        3. maximum memory/runtime performance is sought
        4. ...

    6. Describe how you would insert an element into the front of a linked list. How is this different from inserting to
    the end of one?
        pseudo code:
            assign the new node's next_node reference to the current head node
            reassign the head node reference to the new node
        to insert a new node to the end of a linked list (append), you must first traverse the list or otherwise obtain
        a reference to the last node

    7. How would you identify if there is a cycle in a linked list?
        1. either use Floyd's cycle section algorithm (fast & slow pointers)
        2. keep track of visited nodes

    8. Please walk through your approach using the following examples, including all intermediate steps.

        Linked list with cycle (d -> a)
        a --> b --> c --> d

Stacks

    stack = Stack()
    stack.push(1)
    stack.push(2)
    print(stack.pop())
    stack.push(3)
    stack.push(4)
    print(stack.pop())
    print(stack.pop())

    1. What is printed when the above code is run?
        2\n4\n3\n

    2. What is the current state of the stack after the above code is run?
        stack(1, )

    3. Give one real-life example of a Stack.
        things placed on top of each other, such as plates

    queue = Queue()
    queue.enqueue(1)
    queue.enqueue(2)
    print(queue.dequeue())
    queue.enqueue(3)
    queue.enqueue(4)
    print(queue.dequeue())
    print(queue.dequeue())

    1. What is printed when this code is run?
        1\n2\n3\n

    2. What is the current state of the queue after this code is run?
        queue(4, )

    3. Give one real-life example of a Queue.
        standing in a line to, e.g. buy tickets
