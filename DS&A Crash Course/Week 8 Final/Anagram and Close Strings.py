'''
Determine if these 2 strings are anagrams in O(n) runtime

You can assume that a,b are strings with only letters.
You should ignore capitalizations.

For example,
check_anagram("inTegRal", "Triangle") -> True

def check_anagram(a: str, b: str) -> bool:
    pass


'''
Given 2 strings determine how many full and partial matches they have.

a = BEARS
b = BEAST
-> (3,1)

3 full matches because BEA
1 partial match since S is in the remaining part of the string but incorrect index.

a = BANANA
b = ORANGE
-> (0, 2)

0 full matches and 2 partial matches for AN.

Return as a tuple (full matches, partial matches)
