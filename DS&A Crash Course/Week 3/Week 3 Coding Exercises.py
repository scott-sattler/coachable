Return the list of numbers as a string separated by space using recursion

def recurse(lst: list[int]) -> None:
    pass


'''
2. Calculate the factorial of N iteratively and recursively
'''


def fact_iter(n: int) -> int:
    pass


def fact_recursive(n: int) -> int:

'''
3. Use binary search to find the index of a list that a certain number exists at. 
Return -1 if number does not exist. Assume that the list is sorted.

4. Use binary search to find the index of a list that is the biggest number less than or equal to the given value. 
Return -1 if such a number does not exist. Assume that the list is sorted.
